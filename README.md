# LeetCode Practice

This repo tracks my LeetCode practice, mainly in Java, organized by topic.

## Structure

- `arrays-and-hashing/`  
- `two-pointers/`  
- `sliding-window/`  
- `stack/`  
- `binary-search/`  
- `linked-list/`  
- `trees/`  
- `graphs/`  
- `dynamic-programming/`  

Each problem lives in its own folder:

`<topic>/<id>-<problem-title>/`

with:

- `Solution.java`
- `README.md` describing problem, approaches, and notes.
